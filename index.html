    <h3>ABOUT VISAKH</h3>
       I am a Indian photographer, abstract artist and geographer who has a keen intrest in photography and life around the wrold. Photography for me has always been an excape from reality,
       being able to pause a moment and re-live the moment again and again. Photography was invented about 100 years ago, in those old day only few people could afford a camera.
       In almost every sphere of human activity nowadays, photography has now come to play a very significant role. Cameras and films are now cheap and easy to use. Photography is an art that cannot be teached but can be learned.
       The main trick in photography is one has to analyse the movement and forsee what will happen and be ready to click the shutter button thats all what it takes.
       Through this website i would like to show people that one does'nt have to be an expert in the field of photography and gadgets doesnt play a major role in this art form.
